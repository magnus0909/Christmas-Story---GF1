       Through trust, kindness, or courage, Luna receives help from those she believed in: the ice spirit, the reindeer, the old elf, or even the repaired machine. The clues lead her to the Old Lighthouse, where the Winter Thief hid the star at the very top.
        Luna lifts the star. It glows warmly in her hands, and the sky bursts into shimmering northern lights. Christmas is saved, and the village celebrates when she returns home.
